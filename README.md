Removal of cloud noise in satellite imagery data using Artificial Intelligence(AI)


This research project addresses the complex challenge of cloud noise in satellite imagery employing advanced artificial intelligence models for detection and removal. Our investigation spans multiple phases, beginning with a baseline examination of image classification models like LightCSPNet and progressing to transformer-based models such as Vision Transformer (ViT), CLIP, and Align. The study focuses on their advantages and limitations in cloud and cloud-shadow detection, leveraging datasets like SPARCS, Landsat 8, and Band 9 satellite data for comprehensive evaluation.

Building upon successful model development, the project extends toward practical deployment on small satellites. Two main objectives guide this phase: optimizing models for image preprocessing tasks to enhance efficiency in small satellite systems, and fine-tuning models using data from the Maine Space Complex small satellite for adaptation to regional characteristics. Beyond technical advancements, our research holds broader impacts, including improved environmental monitoring, conservation efforts, and community engagement. The models, equipped with effective cloud noise removal, enable answering broader research questions. Specifically, the project explores the effects of global warming in coastal areas through image processing and object detection tasks.

The deployment of our models will contribute to real-time environmental monitoring, supporting conservation initiatives, and aiding decision-makers in coastal management. Additionally, educational outreach initiatives aim to inspire future generations to space technology, artificial intelligence, and environmental science. In summary, our project is a multidimensional endeavor that combines cutting-edge technology with practical applications, environmental stewardship, and societal engagement, aiming to make a lasting positive impact on both local communities and the broader scientific community.




The dataset that was used finally wa sreally large and could not be upoaded directly to github. It was rather uploaded to google drive. The link to it is as below;
